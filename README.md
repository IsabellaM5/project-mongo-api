# Mongo API Project üêô

I've built a RESTful API using a database to store and retrieve data. 

I used MongoDB for the database, mongoose for the modelling and manipulation of data and Express.js (Node.js framework)


## The problem

The main task was to build a RESTful API and to use a database to store and retrieve data, which I populate the API with.
